## Chapter 1: Importing the Data
In the initial phase of this project, we begin by importing the dataset. The dataset is retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of information about different types of wine. We use the read.table function to load the data, specifying the data source, separator, column names, and other relevant parameters. After loading the data, we examine its dimensions, check for missing values, and generate a summary to gain an initial understanding of its structure and content.


In this chapter, we establish the foundation of our analysis by obtaining and preparing the dataset for further exploration and modeling.

## Chapter 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the second chapter, we dive into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial step in any data science project as it helps us understand the characteristics and relationships within the dataset. We utilize libraries like skimr to generate comprehensive statistics and visualizations. These statistics include measures of central tendency, distribution summaries, and data quality checks. Visualizations, such as histograms and correlation matrices, provide insights into feature relationships and potential patterns within the data.


In this chapter, we gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's properties, which will inform our modeling decisions.

## Chapter 3: Building the Model
This chapter revolves around constructing a predictive model using the dataset. We start by preparing the dataset for modeling, specifically focusing on the target variable. In this case, the 'Class' variable, representing different wine classes, is converted into a factor.


Next, we introduce the decision tree model, a popular choice for classification tasks. We utilize the tree package to build an initial decision tree model. The model's structure is visualized to provide a high-level overview.


## Chapter 4: Model Evaluation
With the model constructed, we move on to evaluating its performance. Initially, the model is trained on a subset of the dataset. We use a random seed to ensure reproducibility and obtain a training set of 150 instances.


The decision tree model is trained on the training set, and predictions are made on the test set. The results are then compared to the actual class labels, allowing us to calculate performance metrics.


## Chapter 5: Model Pruning and Refinement
In this chapter, we address model complexity and overfitting by performing pruning on the decision tree. The decision tree model is initially built without constraints, which may lead to overly complex structures that do not generalize well to new data. Pruning aims to simplify the tree while maintaining predictive accuracy.

We use cross-validation to determine the optimal level of pruning. Cross-validation helps us find the right trade-off between model complexity and performance.


Once the optimal pruning level is determined, we prune the decision tree accordingly. The pruned tree is visualized and evaluated to assess its performance compared to the unpruned version.


## Chapter 6: Conclusion and Model Assessment
In the final chapter, we conclude the project by summarizing our findings and model assessment. We have successfully imported and explored the dataset, built a decision tree model, evaluated its performance, and refined it through pruning. The pruned model provides better generalization and improved predictive accuracy. We emphasize the importance of model assessment and selection, which are critical aspects of any machine learning project. This project serves as a practical example of classification modeling and the iterative process of refining models for better performance and interpretability.
